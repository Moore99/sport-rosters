# CLAUDE.md — Sports Rostering App

Read this file first. Reflects the actual current state, not the original spec.

---

## Running the Application

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ
flutter pub get   # After modifying pubspec.yaml
flutter clean     # Often fails on OneDrive repos due to file locking — safe to ignore
flutter doctor
```

**Build APK for Android:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ
```

**Build AAB for Play Store:**
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ
```
AAB output: `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering\app\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab`
Note: Flutter reports "failed to produce .aab file" due to the build junction — the file IS there at the path above, ignore the warning.

**Install APK on connected device:**
```bash
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe" install -r "C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe" shell am force-stop com.sportsrostering.app
```

**iOS builds**: No Mac available — all iOS builds via **Codemagic** (cloud CI). Push to GitHub, trigger Codemagic manually.

**Note**: The `build/` directory is a Windows junction pointing to `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering` to avoid OneDrive file locking. APK output lands at `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`. If the junction is ever lost, recreate with:
```
cmd /c "mklink /J C:\users\john\onedrive\projects\sports-rostering\build C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering"
```
To force a clean build, delete `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering` contents (not the folder itself) then rebuild.

---

## Testing & Code Quality

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze   # Lint + static analysis
```

### Windows `flutter analyze` False Positives
On Windows, you may see false-positive URI errors like:
```
Error: Uri is unavailable — 'dart:html' can't be accessed on this platform.
```
These are pre-existing, non-blocking, and can be ignored. They occur due to platform-specific conditional imports in dependencies. If these become noisy and you need to verify other warnings pass, run:
```bash
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
```
This still catches actual errors.

## Architecture Overview

### Stack
- **Flutter 3.x** — Web, Android, iOS
- **Riverpod** (`flutter_riverpod ^2.4.9`) — state management
- **GoRouter** (`go_router ^17.1.0`) — navigation
- **Firebase** — Auth, Firestore, Messaging, Crashlytics, Storage, Analytics, App Check
- **Google AdMob** — banner + interstitial + rewarded ads
- **In-App Purchases** — one-time "Remove Ads"
- **Material 3** — UI toolkit

### No Custom Server
There is no custom backend server. All data goes through Firebase SDKs directly from the Flutter client. AWS SES (email invites) is deferred until a server is available.

## Key Business Rules

### Rankings — COACH PRIVATE
- Rankings are stored in the `rankings` Firestore collection.
- **Players cannot read their own rankings or anyone else's.**
- Only team admins (coaches) can read and write rankings.
- Rankings influence lineup auto-generation (admin-only feature).
- NEVER expose rankings in player-facing screens or API responses.

### User Roles
| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| System Admin | All teams, all users, sports config, broadcast email |
| Team Admin (Coach) | Schedule, roster approve/deny, rankings (private), lineups, drop-ins |
| Player | View schedule, RSVP availability, drop-in signup, own profile |

---

## Compliance (GDPR + PIPEDA)

### Account Deletion
Full cascade required when a user deletes their account:
`availability` → `rankings` → `lineups` (assignments) → `dropInSessions.signups` → `users`

Use a Cloud Function or Firestore batch write to guarantee atomicity.

### Data Minimization
- `phone` and `photoUrl` are optional — collect only on explicit user action
- Do not log personal data in Crashlytics

### Consent
- Push notification permission requested explicitly with explanation
- Optional profile fields (phone, photo) shown with purpose text

### Required In-App Screens
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy (must reference GDPR/PIPEDA rights)
- `/terms` — Terms of Service

### Firebase Region
Firestore region: **northamerica-northeast2 (Toronto)** — selected for PIPEDA compliance.

---

## Firestore Security Rules

Rules live in `firestore.rules`. Key constraints:
- Rankings: **team admins ONLY** (read + write) — players denied
- Users: any signed-in user can read (needed for name resolution in rosters/drop-in lists)
- Teams: any signed-in user can read; admins write
- Events: team members read; admins write
- Drop-in signups: player can add/remove only their own UID
- Availability: player writes only their own; signed-in users can read (null resource handled)
- JoinRequests: any signed-in user can read; admins update/delete

**Critical patterns learned:**
- Rules using `resource.data.X` fail with permission-denied when the doc doesn't exist (`resource == null`). Always guard: `resource == null || isTeamMember(resource.data.teamId)`
- Stream providers MUST watch `currentUserProvider` so they restart on sign-out/sign-in. Without this, a stream that gets permission-denied on sign-out stays in error state for the next user. See `teamProvider`, `teamEventsProvider`, `dropInSessionProvider`.
- `FirebaseFirestore.instance.clearPersistence()` on sign-out helps but is unreliable if listeners are still active — the real fix is auth-aware providers.

---

## Riverpod Patterns (from nuclear-motd-mobile)

- Use `StateNotifierProvider` for mutable state
- Use `ref.read(provider.notifier).method()` to invoke actions — do NOT use `ref.invalidate()` on StateNotifierProvider (timing issues)
- Use `ref.watch()` for reactive rebuilds, `ref.read()` for one-time actions
- Use `Future.microtask()` for side effects triggered inside `build()`
- Derived providers (e.g. `unreadCountProvider`) should be plain `Provider<T>` watching upstream state — no API call

---

## AdMob

See `lib/core/config/app_config.dart` for ad unit ID constants. Use test IDs during development:
- Banner test ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111`
- Interstitial test ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1033173712`
- Rewarded test ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`

Swap to live IDs before Play Store / App Store submission.

---

## IAP — Remove Ads

Product ID: `com.sportsrostering.app.remove_ads` (to be confirmed in Play Console / App Store Connect)

Reuse the corrected IAP flow from nuclear-motd-mobile (build 1.0.2+99):
- `PurchaseStatus.error` must NOT call `setAdsFree(true)`
- Wait for `PurchaseStatus.restored` or `PurchaseStatus.purchased` before granting entitlement
- Store `adFree: true` in Firestore `users` doc (survives reinstall)

---

## iOS-Specific (Critical — from nuclear-motd-mobile)

**iOS 26 SceneDelegate fix is REQUIRED** before any iOS build:
- `AppDelegate.swift` must include an explicit `SceneDelegate` class (inlined, no separate .swift file)
- `Info.plist` must set `UISceneDelegateClassName = $(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).SceneDelegate`
- Do NOT set `UISceneDelegateClassName` to `AppDelegate` — causes SIGABRT
- Plugins registered with `flutterEngine`, not `self`
- `Firebase.initializeApp()` called in Dart `main.dart` — do NOT add `FirebaseApp.configure()` to AppDelegate

**iOS Deployment Target:**
- Minimum supported: **iOS 17.0** (as of March 2026, required for Xcode 26 / iOS 26 SDK)
- Set in `ios/Podfile`: `platform :ios, '17.0'`
- Set in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`: `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 17.0`

---

## Version Management

**Single source of truth: `version.txt`** at repo root (e.g., `1.0.3`).

- `version.txt` — controls the marketing version name for both platforms
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` reads `versionName` from `version.txt`; `versionCode` from `$BUILD_NUMBER` env var (Codemagic) or falls back to `flutter.versionCode` (local builds)
- `codemagic.yaml` passes `--build-name=$(cat version.txt) --build-number=$BUILD_NUMBER` to `flutter build ipa`
- `pubspec.yaml` version should stay in sync with `version.txt` (used as local build fallback); build number in pubspec is only used for local APK builds

**To release a new version:**
1. Edit `version.txt` (e.g., `1.0.3` → `1.0.4`)
2. Update `pubspec.yaml` version to match (increment build number for local testing)
3. Commit and push → trigger Codemagic for iOS; build APK locally for Android
4. Codemagic auto-increments `$BUILD_NUMBER` for iOS
5. Verify AAB/APK signing key before uploading to Play Store

**Build numbers are now Codemagic-managed** — both platforms use `$BUILD_NUMBER` so they stay aligned across releases.

---

## Development Workflow

### Android Testing
1. `flutter build apk --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS=AIzaSyAY590kSYhhKKzu6VVlsA0xO_VcpdNE3DQ`
2. `adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
3. `adb shell am force-stop com.sportsrostering.app`
4. Launch manually; `flutter logs` to monitor

### iOS Release (Codemagic)
1. Bump `version` in `pubspec.yaml`
2. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push origin main`
3. Trigger Codemagic build manually → TestFlight

## Current Production Versions

| Platform | Version | Build | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Android (Play Store) | 1.1.9 | 30 | Internal Testing + Under Review |
| Android (Play Store) | 1.1.8 | 28 | Live |

## Store URLs

| Page | URL |
|------|-----|
| Privacy Policy (Android) | https://moore99.github.io/sport-rosters/privacy |
| Privacy Policy (iOS) | https://nuclear-motd.com/privacy (combined policy, still live) |
| Terms of Service | https://moore99.github.io/sport-rosters/terms |
| Delete Account | https://moore99.github.io/sport-rosters/delete-account |

**Note:** Android pages are served from GitHub Pages (`docs/` folder, `moore99/sport-rosters` repo). iOS uses the nuclear-motd.com combined privacy policy. The nuclear-motd.com/sports-rostering/* paths are dead (lost in Docker migration — do not use).

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

### Android IAP Validation — ✅ Resolved (2026-04-02)
- `validateIap` Cloud Function fully enforced on both iOS and Android
- Service account `play-iap-validator@sports-rostering.iam.gserviceaccount.com` granted Financial data + Manage orders in Play Console → Users and permissions
- `ANDROID_VALIDATION_ENABLED = true` in `functions/index.js`
- Note: "Setup → API access" no longer exists in Play Console UI — service accounts are now invited via Users and permissions like regular users
- **Secrets already set:** `APPLE_IAP_SHARED_SECRET` ✅, `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` ✅

### Google Sign-In — ✅ Resolved (1.0.4 build 8)
- `google-services.json` updated with all 3 fingerprints (debug SHA-1, release SHA-1, Play App Signing SHA-256)
- Google Sign-In working on Play Store installs as of 1.0.4 (8)
- iOS Google Sign-In fix (missing `CFBundleURLTypes` URL scheme) applied in 1.0.3 ✅

### Android minSdk
- Set to `maxOf(flutter.minSdkVersion, 23)` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Required by `local_auth` (biometrics). Flutter default is 21; biometrics need API 23+.
- A linter/Flutter Gradle plugin upgrade may revert this to `flutter.minSdkVersion` — if builds break, check this line first.

### Google Places Autocomplete — API Key
- **Separate keys required for Android and iOS** — Google Cloud doesn't allow a single key for both platforms
- **Android key**: restrict to Android app (`com.sportsrostering.app`) + SHA-1: `6F:04:08:95:C2:07:C5:AC:6C:AC:51:47:5D:83:16:D6:ED:1B:D5:8F`
- **iOS key**: restrict to iOS app bundle (`com.sportsrostering.app`)
- Keys injected at build time via `--dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID=...` and `--dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS=...`
- Codemagic: set both `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_ANDROID` and `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_IOS` in Keys group
- The location field falls back gracefully to plain text if Places is unavailable (e.g. local `flutter run` without `--dart-define`)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `flutter clean` fails on OneDrive | Safe to ignore — file locking issue. Delete `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering` manually if needed |
| APK not found after build | Check `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering\app\outputs\flutter-apk\` (Windows junction path) |
| AAB build says "failed" but file exists | Ignore — Flutter reports this falsely due to build junction. File is at `C:\BuildTemp\sports-rostering\app\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab` |
| iOS build fails with SIGABRT | Check `Info.plist` — `UISceneDelegateClassName` must be `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).SceneDelegate`, NOT `AppDelegate` |
| Biometrics fail on Android | Check `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — `minSdk` must be ≥23 |

### Runtime Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Rankings visible to players | Check Firestore rules — ensure `request.auth.token.teamAdmin == true` before allowing read |
| Stream providers stay in error after sign-out | Ensure providers watch `currentUserProvider` — see Firestore Security Rules section |
| AdMob not showing | Verify app ID in `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) / `Info.plist` (iOS) matches AdMob console |
| IAP restore not working | Check network — Apple requires active connection for restore requests |
